###Harvest
This tab describes the problem detailing that:
<br/>
<br/>
Agriculture is an information business. 
Whether you are a farmer deciding what to plant… 
A supermarket pricing goods…
Or a public sector official needing information to plan policies… 

We all need information. HarvestAPI was built to remove the friction preventing you from getting the agriculture data you need.

Description: Unipath is an object-oriented front end to the file/directory functions
        scattered throughout several Python library modules.  It's based on Jason
        Orendorff's *path.py* but does not adhere as strictly to the underlying
        functions' syntax, in order to provide more user convenience and higher-level
        functionality. Unipath is stable, well-tested, and has been used in production
        since 2008.
